          <p>Since I’ve been a kid I’ve always been storming up ideas. 
            I didn’t know it but I was a comic artists in 3rd grade. 
            I sketched up a comic of a squirrel and 
            my fellow school children loved it. It felt fulfilling seeing my friends laugh and
            interact with something I made, and that the ideas in my head can be 
            brought into reality.
            That’s the beauty of creativity.</p>

          <p>My name is Daniel Elizondo and I'm currently a senior Anthropology Major
            and Entrepreneurship Minor student at UT Austin. More importantly, I'm a self-taught web developer
            and UI/UX designer. I believe I can create businesses and design experiences that 
            help everyone ease and elevate their lives.

        <div class="item2 to-fade-in"> <p> Frame is an augmented reality art gallery. We provide galleries and artists the ability to 
          share and experience art from all around the world in the comfort of your home. Music has Spotify and Movies has 
          Netflix and a billion other streaming services, but the average  doesn't have a platform like that. That's what we set out to fix. </p> </div>
        <div class="item3 to-fade-in"> <p>I interviewed over 50 artists about their struggles or success as an artist and how they navigated 
          the art world. Part of what I learned is how importnant a place just for them to display their art. Instagram and Etsy have their good points,
          but a private space just for them, like a gallery, is priceless. Everyone should be able to share their art with anyone.
           </p> </div>
        <div class="item4 to-fade-in"> <p> I designed and wrote the copy for the company <a href="https://www.frame-gallery.com/">website</a>, I still run the company <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frameappofficial/">instagram</a> and 
          worked with my friends <a href="https://www.tonileon.com">Tony Leon</a> and <a href="https://www.leocantoran.com">Leo Cantoran</a> on the prototype, logo, and other graphic work for the company. I also manage public
          outreach with galleries and artists. </p> </div>

        <div class="item8 to-fade-in"> <p>The logo is a great example of the growth and exploration that I went through. I wanted something that was colorful
          and ambiguous, both a beautiful 2D shape as well as a 3D box, because it highlights the purpose of the app: turning a 2D experience into a
          3D one. The colors I chose came from the emotions I wanted to bring out: yellow for warmth, pink for passion, and purple for curiosity and imagination.
          After I decided my colors, I searched for when these colors occur naturally together. The answer I found was black opal, but instead of distinct colors,
          I transformed it into a gradient.

          <p class="text1 elem to-fade-in"> Scholar Cloud was an assignment in my Entreprenuership class, it was dreamed up to be a scholarship management system
            for universities and schools, where scholarships are actually easily available, organized, and formally integrated into schools. Not an afterthought for schools or students. </p>
          <p class="text2 elem to-fade-in"> We interviewed a dozen students of varying age and grade, and interviewed a few professionals who worked with YMCA and counselors
            of different high schools, and from our open format of our questions, we were able to brainstorm a product that can help solve administration and 
            making scholarships more available. </p>
          <p class="text3 elem to-fade-in"> I completed the Scholar Cloud prototype with input from my peers and from follow up interviews. I had to restructure the prototype to better
            serve both the instituion and student sides of things.  </p>

          the research symposium she and her organization were helping present. I had a simple, general vision that I eventually 
          narrowed down. I found it hard to keep adding things that my clients asked for, but I always found a way to adapt.
